These test cases test the single instance functionality with
and without applauncherd/invoker.

Requirements:
1. DISPLAY environment variable must be set correctly.
2. DBus session bus must be running.
3. DBus session bus address must be stored in /tmp/session_bus_address.user.
4. Given application supports launcher with .launcher binary in /usr/bin/.
5. launcher application should be installed.
6. single-instance app should be installed
